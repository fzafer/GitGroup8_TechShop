# GitGroup8_TechShop

In this Group project, we are preparing a tech-shop
First of all, we create a parent java file named techEquipments defining the main properties of the goods in the store.
After that we create child files as Notebook_Veli, MobilePhone_Zafer, Watch, etc., and we'll fill up the codes in them
Ä°f necessary, we'll create child files to the parent or those child files
At the end, we'll create a TechShop to create tech objects which are in our store and ready to be sold
